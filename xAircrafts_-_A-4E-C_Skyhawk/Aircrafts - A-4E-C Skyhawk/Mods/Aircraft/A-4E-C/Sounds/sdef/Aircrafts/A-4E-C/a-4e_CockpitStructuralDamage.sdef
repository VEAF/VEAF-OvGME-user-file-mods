-- to ensure this sound is unique each time it is heard,
-- it should play in-flight continuously, silently,
-- manipulating gain value when the event triggers
-- setting gain value based on the amount of shake input
-- maybe short-pulse this on landing gear overspeed damage?
-- (let the attack and release do the work)
