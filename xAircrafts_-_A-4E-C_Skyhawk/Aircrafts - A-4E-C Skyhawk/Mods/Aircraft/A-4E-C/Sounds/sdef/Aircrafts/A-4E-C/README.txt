DO NOT COPY OR USE THESE SOUNDS
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Some assets used in the creation of these sounds 
were made with purchased and licensed assets. 
While many parts of this project are open source, 
these sounds are not. 

While they are significantly transformed 
from their original sources, taking these sounds 
for use in your own project is theft: 
not from the Community A-4E-C project, 
but from the original licensors of the source material.

Distributing these sounds puts YOU in legal jeopardy 
should the licensors of the original assets find out,
and rest assured, there are entire teams of people 
whose entire livelihood is chasing theives down
and making them pay (in spades). 

The Community A-4E-C project is not reponsible 
for your copyright infringement.
