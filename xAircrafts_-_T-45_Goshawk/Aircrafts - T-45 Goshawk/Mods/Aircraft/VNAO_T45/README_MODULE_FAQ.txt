VNAO T-45C Goshawk Initial Release Features

•	MULTICREW! Teaching new DCS pilots has never been easier. With the VNAO T-45 you have the capability to have an instructor pilot (IP) along for the ride to make sure your first sessions go silky smooth. The IP has the ability to see all the vital readings the student pilot does, including altitude, airspeed, and AOA. Fully functioning Multi Function Displays in the back seat allow all the necessary information to be displayed so he can guide you step by step through the training process. If you find yourself in an unsafe situation, the IP can assume control of the aircraft from the rear seat and safely recover the aircraft. Once the aircraft is back in control, they can pass command back to the student so the training session can continue.
 
•	CARRIER OPS! The T-45 was built to train the next generation of fighter pilots to achieve one of the hardest feats in all of aviation: landing on an aircraft carrier. The VNAO T-45C is capable of landing and launching from the “DCS Supercarrier” as well as the base CVN-74 Stennis. 

•	FULL FIDELITY: In order to bring the best flight experience possible, almost every vital system can be controlled with the click of a mouse in the cockpit or mapped directly to your HOTAS controls.

•	COLD START: Enjoy the immersion of starting in a cold and dark jet. The VNAO T-45 has a fully modeled cold start sequence. See more about this sequence in the initial release documents.

•	NAVIGATION: Always know where you are headed with the ability to place waypoints in the mission editor. Make sure you tune your Tacan and Navigation radios so you can safely arrive at your destination no matter the weather conditions.

•	COMMUNICATIONS: The VNAO T-45C Goshawk is compatible with the popular DCS addon SRS, featuring two fully functional ARN-182 radios and an intercom between the pilot and instructor. Just install the included custom SRS script included in the base mod folder into the C:\Users\*****\Saved Games\DCS.openbeta\Mods\Services\DCS-SRS\Scripts folder, overwrite and you're all set!

•	EXTREME MODEL DETAIL: Every single panel and flight surface was carefully modeled to meet the highest standard of accuracy and quality. Custom lighting with working rotating beacons will leave you dazzled during day or night ops. All aspects were created from original schematics, various source reference photos, videos and first hand information graciously provided by our team of real world aviators, maintainers and veteran pilots. Still very much a wip but we feel confident that this is the most complete and accurate version of the T-45C Goshawk available in a sim to date.

•	TRAINING WEAPONS: The VNAO T-45 has the ability to equip and deploy BDU-33 smoke bombs, as well as the M274 Smoke Rockets.
